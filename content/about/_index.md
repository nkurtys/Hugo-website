      title: What is NFDI4Microbiota?
      text: |
        NFDI4Microbiota is a consortium that is part of the German NFDI (National research Data Infrastructure). The vision of the NFDI4Microbiota consortium is that researchers in microbiology (including bacteriology, virology, protistology, mycology and parasitology) can translate research data easily into a deep understanding of microbial species and their interactions on a molecular level.

    title: Aims and objectives
    text: |
      - Generate a broad awareness of the importance of the FAIR principles, open science and reproducible research in the microbiological community and drive a cultural change toward their widespread adaptation.
      - Equip the community with the required skills and literacy for efficient and data-driven microbial research by providing a comprehensive training program.
      - Increase the value of other NFDIs by adding microbial expertise and connecting the national and international microbiology communities.
      - Improve the research process by mobilizing, structuring and linking available data, information and knowledge related to microorganisms.
      - Support high-quality research data management by introducing professional data stewards into the microbiological research process.
      - Increase the value of data by standardizing and systematically collecting rich metadata and building tools for querying.
      - Make research more reproducible by standardizing data processing and analysis.
      - Provide computational tools and infrastructure for the translation of data into new knowledge.
      - Provide central information hubs tailored to address the needs of the microbial research community and its sub-fields.
      - Continuously adapt the solutions provided to meet the future needs of our microbiology community.
